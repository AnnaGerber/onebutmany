# One, but many

"One, but many" aims to provide a graphical discovery interface for exploring Australia's multicultural heritage. By drawing on historical immigration statistics and the National Archives of Australia's Passenger Arrivals dataset, and by enriching that data with archival material including images, video and metadata about countries, One, but many aims to tell the stories of the people who came to Australia, their journies, and the places from which they came.

Developed for GovHack 2013, "One, but many" was developed by Anna Gerber (concept, design, data preparation and code), Tamara McKenzie (concept and design) and Brendan Halliday (data preparation) from the Hack the Evening maker collective.
